- -- I have been trying to get ubuntu installed on my samsung chromebook (so I can play Old School Runescape). I did have it running just fine last year or so. I don't recall how or why it stopped working, but it did. I have since had issues getting it back to working order. Most of what I do here will be related to that issue.
